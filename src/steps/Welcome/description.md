# Welcome to `clubhouse-protocol` tutorial

Please be aware that this project still is in under development, and a lot more work is needed before it becomes useful. For now this serves more as a demo of what this hopefully could be.

Also, if you decide to look at the code for this tutorial be aware that it is very much POC code and not optimized for maintainability yet
